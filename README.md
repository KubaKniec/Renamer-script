This Python script allows users to remove a specified substring from filenames, either for a single file or all files in a folder, while preserving their extensions. 
Users can choose their mode, provide the relevant paths, and the script will rename the files accordingly.
It includes error handling for non-existent files or directories and allows users to exit the program easily.

**Use dist/Renamer.exe to run the sript on desktop**
